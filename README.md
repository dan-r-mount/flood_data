# UK Flood Risk Assessment Tool

CLI tool for assessing flood risk at UK postcodes, functionality similar to the [official government service](https://check-long-term-flood-risk.service.gov.uk/risk#).

## üéØ What This Tool Does

- **Distance calculations** to nearest flood risk areas similar to [this website](https://nafra.azurewebsites.net/)
- **Risk categorization** following the official [Environment Agency RoFRS probabilistic model](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/96ab4342-82c1-4095-87f1-0082e8d84ef1)  
- **Multiple flood types**: Surface Water, Rivers & Sea, Reservoirs, Groundwater
- **Live data integration** from Environment Agency APIs
- **Future risk projections** with climate change considerations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+

### Setup
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dan-r-mount/flood_data.git
cd flood_data

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv flood_env
source flood_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: flood_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Assessment
```bash
# Check flood risk for any UK postcode
python flood_checker_integrated.py --postcode "E1 6AN"

# Example with verbose output
python flood_checker_integrated.py --postcode "HU1 1AA" --verbose
```

### Expected Output
```
üåä INTEGRATED FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT

   Status: You are INSIDE a surface water flood risk area

üåä RIVERS AND SEA FLOOD RISK: VERY LOW  
   Distance to nearest area: 1016 meters

üèîÔ∏è  RESERVOIR FLOOD RISK: VERY LOW
   Note: No reservoir flood risk areas found at this location
```

## üìä Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Working
| Component | Status | Data Source | Resolution/Granularity | Accuracy Level |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Surface Water** | ‚úÖ Working | FRA Approximation | Large polygon areas (189 total) | **Good for general screening** - identifies areas with known surface water risk, but lacks 50m precision |
| **Rivers & Sea** | ‚úÖ Working | FRA Approximation | Large polygon areas (189 total) | **Good approximation** - covers significant flood risk areas |  
| **Reservoirs** | ‚úÖ Working | Live EA API | Individual reservoir extents | **Highly accurate** - live official data |
| **Distance Calculations** | ‚úÖ Working | Spatial Analysis | Meter-level precision | **Highly accurate** - unique feature not in gov.uk |
| **Risk Scoring** | ‚úÖ Working | [Official RoFRS Categories](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/96ab4342-82c1-4095-87f1-0082e8d84ef1) | 4-band probabilistic system | **Officially compliant** - exact government categories |

### üîÑ Enhanced Versions Available (Pending Data)
| Component | Current Resolution | Enhanced Dataset | Enhanced Resolution | Accuracy Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Surface Water** | Large FRA polygons | [RoFSW 50m grids](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/bad20199-6d39-4aad-8564-26a46778fd94) | 50m x 50m cells | **Major improvement** - property-level precision vs area-level screening |
| **Rivers & Sea** | Large FRA polygons | RoFRS detailed modeling | 50m x 50m cells with defenses | **Significant improvement** - includes flood defense modeling |
| **Groundwater** | Not available | BGS geological data | Site-specific | **Complete new capability** - currently missing |

## üìä Data Accuracy & Limitations

### Current Surface Water Assessment
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important for Colleagues**: The surface water flood risk is currently based on **Flood Risk Areas (FRA) approximation**, not the official 50m precision surface water maps.

| What This Means | Current Implementation | Official Gov.UK Service |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Data Source** | FRA polygons tagged as "Surface Water" | Risk of Flooding from Surface Water (RoFSW) 50m grids |
| **Spatial Resolution** | Large areas (e.g., "London, Thames" covers many postcodes) | 50m x 50m individual cells |
| **Risk Assessment** | Distance-based approximation | Actual flood modeling probability |
| **Use Case** | ‚úÖ **Good for area screening** - "Is this location in a known surface water risk area?" | ‚úÖ **Property-level precision** - exact risk at specific address |
| **Accuracy** | **Approximate** - may over/under-estimate for specific properties | **High precision** - based on detailed modeling |

### When Current Data Works Well
- ‚úÖ Identifying areas with **known surface water flood risk**
- ‚úÖ **General planning** and area-level risk screening  
- ‚úÖ Understanding **relative risk** between different locations
- ‚úÖ **Distance calculations** to flood risk boundaries (unique feature)

### When Enhanced Data Is Needed
- ‚ùå Property-level flood risk assessment
- ‚ùå Insurance or planning applications requiring precise risk data
- ‚ùå Detailed flood risk modeling for specific developments

## üíæ Data Access

### Large Dataset Files
Due to GitHub size limitations, the main FRA shapefile (~14MB) is hosted separately:

**Google Drive**: [Flood Risk Areas Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID)

**Contents**:
- `Flood_Risk_AreasPolygon.shp` - Main shapefile
- `Flood_Risk_AreasPolygon.shx` - Shape index
- `Flood_Risk_AreasPolygon.dbf` - Attribute database  
- `Flood_Risk_AreasPolygon.prj` - Projection information
- `Flood_Risk_AreasPolygon.cst` - Character set information

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Download all files from Google Drive
2. Place in the same directory as `flood_checker_integrated.py`
3. The tool will automatically detect and load the data

## üìä Risk Categories

This tool uses the official Environment Agency [Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Sea (RoFRS)](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/96ab4342-82c1-4095-87f1-0082e8d84ef1) probabilistic risk categories:

- **High** - Greater than or equal to 3.3% chance in any given year (1 in 30)
- **Medium** - Less than 3.3% (1 in 30) but greater than or equal to 1% (1 in 100) chance in any given year  
- **Low** - Less than 1% (1 in 100) but greater than or equal to 0.1% (1 in 1,000) chance in any given year
- **Very Low** - Less than 0.1% chance in any given year (1 in 1,000)

These categories align exactly with the data.gov.uk model used in the official government flood risk service.

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Postcode Input ‚Üí Coordinates ‚Üí Multi-Source Assessment:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FRA Shapefile Analysis (Surface Water & Rivers/Sea)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Environment Agency API (Reservoirs)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Distance Calculations (All Sources)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Risk Categorization (Government Standards)
```

### Risk Assessment Method
- **Distance-based scoring**: Inside area = HIGH, <100m = MEDIUM, <500m = LOW, >500m = VERY LOW
- **Probability estimates**: Based on Environment Agency categories
- **Future projections**: Climate change factor applied to current risk
- **Multiple sources**: All flood types assessed independently

### Performance
- **Assessment time**: 3-7 seconds per postcode
- **API dependency**: Only reservoir data (with fallback)
- **Offline capability**: Surface water and rivers/sea work without internet

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_examples.py
```

Tests various postcodes:
- **E1 6AN** (London) - High surface water risk
- **HU1 1AA** (Hull) - High multiple flood risks  
- **EH1 1YZ** (Edinburgh) - Low risk area

## ü§ù For Collaborators

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Download FRA dataset from Google Drive (link above)
3. Set up Python environment (see Quick Start)
4. Run test examples to verify setup
5. Try your own postcodes!

### Key Files
- `flood_checker_integrated.py` - Main assessment tool
- `test_examples.py` - Example usage and testing
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This documentation

### Making Changes
- The tool is designed to automatically detect new datasets when added
- For rivers/sea: Place shapefiles in `flood_datasets/rivers_sea/`
- For surface water: Place grids in `flood_datasets/surface_water/`
- All coordinate systems should be British National Grid (EPSG:27700)

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Surface Water**: Currently uses FRA approximation, not precise 50m grids
2. **Rivers/Sea**: Currently uses FRA approximation, waiting for DEFRA access
3. **Groundwater**: Not implemented (requires BGS license)
4. **Climate Projections**: Simplified estimates, not full UKCP18 modeling
5. **Geographic Coverage**: England only (could extend to Wales/Scotland with additional data)
